## Introduction to ONT reads and Flye Assembler

Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has revolutionized sequencing by providing long-read data, enabling the resolution of complex genomic structures that were previously intractable with short-read technologies. However, ONT reads are error-prone, necessitating specialized assembly algorithms that can handle high sequencing error rates while maximizing contiguity and accuracy.

Traditional assemblers designed for short reads rely on de Bruijn graph approaches, which break sequences into fixed k-mers and struggle with error-rich long reads. In contrast, modern long-read assemblers like `Flye` use alternative graph-based strategies to overcome these limitations. Flye specifically constructs repeat graphs to accurately reconstruct genomes while addressing challenges posed by structural variations and repeats. This makes it particularly well-suited for ONT data, producing high-quality, contiguous assemblies for small microbial genomes to large eukaryotic genomes.

The latest ultra-long ONT reads, such as those generated by the PromethION platform, have further improved assembly quality and contiguity. Flye can leverage these ultra-long reads to generate even more accurate and contiguous assemblies, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of genomic analyses.

## Installation and Setup  

Flye is available as module on RCAC clusters. You can load the module using the following command:


```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml flye
flye --version
```

You can also use the Singularity container for HiFiasm, which provides a consistent environment across different systems. The container can be pulled from the BioContainers registry using the following command:

```bash
apptainer pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/flye:2.9.5--py311h2de2dd3_2
apptainer exec hflye_2.9.5--py311h2de2dd3_2.sif flye --version
```

## Overview of Flye Assembler  

Flye is a *de novo* assembler designed for high-error, long-read sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio. It is optimized to handle the inherent noise in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads while producing highly contiguous assemblies. Flye is particularly well-suited for assembling complex genomes, resolving repetitive regions, and reconstructing structural variations that short-read assemblers struggle with.

The Flye assembly workflow typically involves:  

1. **Read preprocessing** – filtering and quality-checking raw ONT reads  
2. **Disjointig generation** – constructing long, error-prone sequences from overlapping reads  
3. **Repeat graph construction** – building a repeat-aware assembly graph to represent genome structure  
4. **Graph resolution** – disentangling repeats and structural variations to produce accurate contigs  
5. **Polishing** – refining assemblies to improve base-level accuracy using read alignment  
6. **Post-processing** – assessing assembly quality and generating final output  

Flye is optimized for this process, leveraging repeat graph-based assembly to generate longer, more contiguous sequences than many traditional long-read assemblers. Its ability to handle highly repetitive regions, coupled with its fast runtime and efficient memory usage, makes it a powerful choice for ONT genome assembly.

## Flye: basic workflow


To run `flye`, you need to provide the input long reads in FASTA or FASTQ format, specifying the long read type, provide estimated genome size, output directory and the threads to use.
The basic command structure is as follows:

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml flye
flye \
  --nano-raw 9994.q20.CCS-filtered-60x.fastq \
  --genome-size 135m \
  --out-dir flye_ont \
  --threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
```

::: callout

## Options used


- `--nano-raw` specifies the input ONT long reads in FASTQ format
- `--genome-size` provides an estimate of the genome size to guide assembly
- `--out-dir` specifies the output directory for Flye results
- `--threads` specifies the number of CPU threads to use for assembly


The input can either be fastq or fasta, compressed or uncompressed. The output will be stored in the directory provided.

:::


## Understanding Flye Output

The output of Flye includes several files and directories that provide information about the assembly process and results. Key components of the Flye output include:


| **File/Folder**        | **Description**    |
|:-|-------------------------|
| **00-assembly/**       | Initial draft assembly output. |
| **10-consensus/**      | Consensus refinement step. |
| **20-repeat/**        | Repeat graph construction and analysis. |
| **30-contigger/**     | Final contig generation step. |
| **40-polishing/**    | Final polishing step for improving assembly quality. |
| assembly.fasta       | _Final polished assembly sequence._ |
| assembly_graph.gfa   | Final assembly graph in GFA format. |
| assembly_graph.gv    | Visualization of final assembly graph. |
| assembly_info.txt    | Summary information about the assembly. |
| flye.log            | Log file detailing the Flye run. |


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Which file should I use as my final assembly?

The `assembly.fasta` file contains the final polished assembly sequence and is typically used as the primary output for downstream analyses. This file represents the best estimate of the assembled genome based on the input data and the Flye assembly process. You can use this file for further analyses, such as gene prediction, variant calling, or comparative genomics studies.

Quick look at metrics for this assembly:

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml quast
quast.py \
    --fast \
    --threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
    -o quast_basic_stats \
    assembly.fasta
```


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Which of these assemblies look better?

Check the `quast_basic_stats/report.txt` file to check assembly statistics. Based on your previous assembly using `hifiasm`, what assembly do you think is better? What metrics are you using to make this decision?
Discuss which assembly has better contiguity and completeness based on these statistics.

## Other important parameters

`flye` provides several [additional parameters](https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye/blob/flye/docs/USAGE.md) that can be used to customize the assembly process and improve results. Some key parameters include:

- Pick the right input type (`--nano-hq`, `--pacbio-hifi`, etc.) → Incorrect selection affects accuracy.
- Always specify `--out-dir` and `--threads` for faster and organized runs.
- Use `--keep-haplotypes` if you don’t want a collapsed assembly.
- For metagenomes, use `--meta` to handle variable coverage.
- If the assembly fails, use `--resume` to avoid losing progress.

## Improving Assembly Quality with Polishing (Optional)

After generating the initial assembly, it is often beneficial to polish the assembly to improve base-level accuracy. Polishing involves aligning the raw reads back to the assembly and correcting errors to produce a more accurate consensus sequence. This step can significantly enhance the quality of the assembly, especially for error-prone long-read data like ONT reads.

Flye provides built-in polishing capabilities. By default, Flye performs one round of polishing to refine the assembly. However, you can customize the polishing process by running polishing separately after the initial assembly.

An example command to polish assembly with accurate PacBio HiFi reads:

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml flye
flye \
  --polish-target SEQ_TO_POLISH \
  --pacbio-raw READS \ 
  --iterations NUM_ITER \
  --out-dir OUTPUTDIR \
  --threads THREADS
```
*You can also provide Bam file as input instead of reads

There are many other polishing tools available, such as `Racon`, `Nanoploish`, and `medaka`, which can be used to further refine the ONT assembly. Each tool has its strengths and limitations, so it is recommended to try different polishing strategies to achieve the best results for your specific dataset. `Medaka` is a popular choice for polishing ONT assemblies due to its accuracy and efficiency.


## HiFiasm for ONT Data (Optional)
 
Since HiFiasm also supports ONT reads for assembly, we can test it out to access the quality of the assembly. The basic command structure is as follows:


```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml hifiasm
hifiasm \
    -t ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
    -o athaliana_ont.asm \
    --ont \
    basecalled_2025-02-12-filtered_60x.fastq
```

::: callout

## Post processing

Once the run completes (~30 mins with 32 threads), you can convert GFA to FASTA using the following command:

```bash
for ctg in *_ctg.gfa; do
    awk '/^S/{print ">"$2"\n"$3}' ${ctg} > ${ctg%.gfa}.fasta
done
```

Get teh basic stats using `quast`:

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml quast
quast.py \
    --fast \
    --threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
    -o quast_basic_stats \
    *_ctg.fasta
```

and run `compleasm` to get the assembly completeness:

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml completeasm
for fasta in *_ctg.fasta; do
    compleasm run \
       -a ${fasta} \
       -o ${fasta%.*} \
       -l brassicales_odb10 \
       -t ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE}
done
```
