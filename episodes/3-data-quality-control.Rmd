## Data Quality Check and Filtering  

- **What is data quality checking and filtering?**
  - Assessing the quality of raw sequencing data before genome assembly.
  - Identifying and removing low-quality or problematic reads before assembly.  
  - Ensuring that the data is suitable for downstream analysis.
  - Better quality ingredients make a better quality cake!  

- **Why is it necessary?**
  - Poor quality data can lead to errors in genome assembly.
  - Low-quality reads can introduce gaps, misassemblies, or incorrect base calls.
  - Filtering out low-quality reads can improve the accuracy and efficiency of assembly.
  - It is a critical step to ensure the success of downstream analyses.

- **What we will do today?**
  - Learn the process of long-read generation (PacBio HiFi and ONT) - a brief overview.
  - Assess raw data quality using `NanoPlot` for PacBio HiFi and ONT reads - hands-on.  
  - Filter reads based on quality and length using `Filtlong` - hands-on.
  - Re-evaluate data post-filtering using `NanoPlot` to confirm improvements - hands-on.

## PacBio HiFi reads from Subreads

**PacBio HiFi** reads can be generated using [Circular Consensus Sequencing](https://ccs.how/) (CCS) program from **PacBio**

- PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) generates HiFi reads by sequencing the same DNA molecule multiple times  
- The more passes over the same molecule, the higher the consensus accuracy  
- Two main stages:  
  - Generate a draft consensus from multiple subreads  
  - Iteratively polish the consensus using all subreads to refine accuracy  

![PacBio CCS overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566db0d0-93e8-40a3-82ce-89ec79c7a8b4)

**What does CCS do?**

1. Filter low-quality subreads based on length and signal-to-noise ratio  
2. Generate an initial consensus using overlapping subreads  
3. Align all subreads to the draft consensus for refinement  
4. Divide sequence into small overlapping windows to optimize polishing  
5. Identify and correct errors, heteroduplex artifacts, and large insertions  
6. Apply polishing algorithms to refine the sequence, removing ambiguities  
7. Compute read accuracy based on error likelihood  
8. Output the final HiFi read if accuracy meets the threshold  

**Why is this important?**  

- Produces highly accurate long reads (99 percent or higher)  
- Enables better genome assembly, especially in complex or repetitive regions  
- Reduces the need for additional error correction  

**How was the data generated?**

Subreads (in bam format) were converted to ccs fastq as follows:

```bash
ccs \
   --hifi-kinetics \
   --num-threads $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE \
   input.subreads.bam \
   output.hifi.bam
samtools fastq \
   output.hifi.bam > output.hifi.fastq
```

**What is the source of this data?**

- The PacBio HiFi reads are from the project [PRJEB50694](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB50694).
- Data is for _Arabidopsis thaliana_ ecotype Col-0, sequenced using PacBio HiFi technology (they also sequenced CLR data for this project).
- The data is publicly available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and the `9994.q20.CCS.fastq.gz` reads were used for analysis.
- Data has been filtered to include only HiFi reads with a Q-score of 20 or higher.


## ONT Reads from MinION Sequencing

**Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)** sequencing generates long reads by passing DNA through a biological nanopore

   - ONT reads are generated in real-time as the DNA strand moves through the nanopore.
   - Dorado is Oxford Nanopore Technologiesâ€™ basecaller that converts raw electrical signals from nanopores into nucleotide sequences using machine learning.  


![Overview of ONT read generation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/624b4209-5f34-4d03-ad12-de95ae85ad75)


**Key steps in `dorado` base calling**

1. **Signal detection**  
   - DNA or RNA molecules pass through a nanopore, disrupting an electrical current.  
   - These disruptions create a unique signal pattern called a **squiggle**.  

2. **Real-time data processing**  
   - The MinKNOW software captures and processes the squiggle into sequencing reads.  
   - Reads include standard nucleotides and potential base modifications like methylation.  

3. **Basecalling with machine learning**  
   - Neural networks, including transformer models, predict the nucleotide sequence from raw signals.  
   - Models continuously improve by training on diverse sequencing data.  

4. **Error correction and refinement**  
   - Dorado refines base predictions to reduce errors, especially in homopolymer regions.  
   - Models are optimized for accuracy across various DNA/RNA types.  

5. **High-speed processing**  
   - Basecalling can be performed **during sequencing** for real-time analysis or **after sequencing** for higher accuracy.  
   - GPUs accelerate computation, enabling rapid basecalling and simultaneous modification detection.  

**Why this matters**

- Enables **real-time sequencing and analysis** for quick decision-making.  
- Uses **advanced machine learning** to improve sequence accuracy over time.  
- Supports **epigenetic modification detection** without extra processing steps.  


**How was the data generated?**

`pod5` ONT reads were basecalled using Dorado as follows:

```bash
# download
wget ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR791/ERR7919757/Arabidopsis-pass.tar.gz
# extract
tar -xvf Arabidopsis-pass.tar.gz # fast5_pass is the extracted directory 
# convert to pod5 format
pod5 convert \
   fast5 fast5_pass --output pod5_pass
# download model
dorado download \
   --model "dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v3.5.2" \
   --models-directory models_dir/
# basecall
dorado basecaller \
   --emit-fastq \
   --output-dir dorado_output_dir \
   models_dir/dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v3.5.2 \
   input_pass.pod5
```

**What is the source of this data?**

- The ONT reads are from the project [PRJEB49840](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB49840). 
- Data is for _Arabidopsis thaliana_ ecotype Col-0, sequenced using R10.4/Q20+ chemistry from MinION cell
- The data is publicly available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and the `pass_fast5` reads were used for basecalling (with commands above).

## A. NanoPlot for Quality Assessment

[NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) [ref](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty149) is a visualization tool designed for quality assessment of long-read sequencing data. It generates a variety of plots, including read length histograms, cumulative yield plots, violin plots of read length and quality over time, and bivariate plots that compare read lengths, quality scores, reference identity, and mapping quality. By providing both single-variable and density-based visualizations, NanoPlot helps users quickly assess sequencing run quality and detect potential issues. The tool also allows downsampling, length and quality filtering, and barcode-specific analysis for multiplexed experiments.

**1. Quality Assessment of PacBio HiFi Reads**

   --verbose \
   --outdir nanoplot_pacbio_pre \
   --prefix At_PacBio_ \
   --plots kde \
   --N50 \
   --dpi 300 \
   --fastq At_pacbio-hifi.fastq.gz
```

## B. Filtering Sequencing Reads


[`Filtlong`](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) is a tool designed to filter long-read sequencing data by selecting a smaller, higher-quality subset of reads based on length and identity. It prioritizes longer reads with higher sequence identity while discarding shorter or lower-quality reads, ensuring that the retained data contributes to more accurate genome assemblies. This filtering step is crucial for improving assembly contiguity, reducing errors, and optimizing computational efficiency by removing excess low-quality data.


**1. Filtering PacBio HiFi Reads**

Filter the PacBio HiFi reads using `Filtlong` to retain only high-quality reads.

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml filtlong
filtlong \
   --target_bases 5400000000 \
   --keep_percent 90 \
   --min_length 1000 \
     At_pacbio-hifi.fastq.gz > At_pacbio-hifi-filtered.fastq
```

**2. Filtering ONT Reads**

Filter the ONT reads using `Filtlong` to retain only high-quality reads.

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml filtlong
filtlong \
   --target_bases 5400000000 \
   --keep_percent 90 \
   --min_length 1000 \
     At_ont-reads.fastq.gz > At_ont-reads-filtered.fastq
```

::: callout

**What does this command do?**

- `--target_bases 5400000000`: Target number of bases to retain in the filtered dataset (5.4 Gb).
- `--keep_percent 90`: Retain reads that cover 90% of the target bases.
- `--min_length 1000`: Minimum read length to keep in the filtered dataset (1000 bp).

:::


## C. Evaluating Data Quality After Filtering  


We will re-run `NanoPlot` on the filtered HiFi and ONT reads to assess the quality of the filtered datasets.

**1. For PacBio HiFi Reads:**

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml nanoplot
NanoPlot \
   --threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
   --verbose \
   --outdir nanoplot_pacbio_post \
   --prefix At_PacBio_post_ \
   --plots kde \
   --N50 \
   --dpi 300 \
   --fastq At_pacbio-hifi-filtered.fastq

```

**2. For ONT Reads:**

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml nanoplot
NanoPlot \
   --threads ${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE} \
   --verbose \
   --outdir nanoplot_ont_post \
   --prefix At_ONT_post_ \
   --readtype 1D \
   --plots kde \
   --N50 \
   --dpi 300 \
   --fastq At_ont-reads-filtered.fastq
```

Now, examine the `At_PacBio_post_NanoPlot-report.html` and `At_ONT_post_NanoPlot-report.html` files to assess the quality of the filtered HiFi and ONT reads. Do you observe any improvements in read quality after filtering?
We will use these filtered reads for downstream genome assembly.


## D. K-mer Based Quality Checks (Optional) 

[GenomeScope](https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0) is a k-mer-based tool used to profile genomes without requiring a reference, providing estimates of genome size, heterozygosity, and repeat content. It uses k-mer frequency distributions from raw sequencing reads to model genome characteristics, making it especially useful for detecting sequencing artifacts and assessing data quality before assembly. In this optional section, we will use GenomeScope to evaluate the quality of our Oxford Nanopore and PacBio reads by identifying potential errors, biases, and coverage issues, helping to refine filtering strategies and improve downstream assembly results [ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14998-3).


**1. For PacBio HiFi Reads:**


```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml kmc
mkdir tmp
ls At_pacbio-hifi-filtered.fastq > FILES
kmc -k21 -t10 -m64 -ci1 -cs10000 @FILES reads tmp/
kmc_tools transform reads histogram reads-pacbio.histo -cx10000
```

**2. For ONT Reads:**

```bash
ml --force purge
ml biocontainers
ml kmc
mkdir tmp
ls At_ont-reads-filtered.fastq > FILES
kmc -k21 -t10 -m64 -ci1 -cs10000 @FILES reads tmp/
kmc_tools transform reads histogram reads-ont.histo -cx10000
```

Now you can visualize the k-mer frequency distributions using GenomeScope to assess the quality of the HiFi and ONT reads. This analysis can help identify potential issues and guide further filtering or processing steps to improve data quality.

To visualize the k-mer frequency distributions:

1. Visit the [GenomeScope website](http://genomescope.org/genomescope2.0/) and upload the `reads-pacbio.histo` OR `reads-ont.histo` files (drag and drop).
2. If you uploaded the `reads-pacbio.histo` file, enter description with `PacBio HiFi`. If you uploaded the `reads-ont.histo` file, enter description with `Oxford Nanopore`.
3. Click on the `Submit` button to generate the k-mer frequency distribution plots.



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge



Q: _Why did the ONT k-mer analysis fail?_

:::::::::::::::: solution

A: High error rates in ONT reads can lead to k-mer counting errors, causing the analysis to fail. K-mer analyses reads rely on accuracy to generate reliable frequency distributions. Only reads higher than Q20 are recommended for k-mer analysis.

**What insights can you gain from the k-mer frequency distributions?**

- Look for peaks and patterns in the k-mer frequency distributions.
- Identify potential issues such as heterozygosity, repeat content, or sequencing errors.
- Did your models converge? What does this indicate about the quality of your data?
