## Introduction to Bionano optical genome mapping (OGM)

Bionano optical mapping is a high-resolution genome analysis technique that generates long-range structural information by labeling and imaging ultra-long DNA molecules. It provides genome-wide maps that can be used to scaffold contigs from sequencing-based assemblies, significantly improving contiguity and structural accuracy. By integrating Bionano maps with assemblies from PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), misassemblies can be corrected, chimeric contigs resolved, and scaffold N50s increased by orders of magnitude. This approach is particularly valuable for complex genomes, where repetitive sequences and structural variations pose challenges for traditional sequencing methods. Bionano hybrid scaffolding has become a standard for enhancing genome assemblies, enabling researchers to achieve high-quality, chromosome-level assemblies efficiently.

## Bionano Solve Hybrid Scaffolding

Bionano Solve improves genome assembly by integrating optical genome mapping data with sequence assemblies, generating ultra-long hybrid scaffolds that enhance contiguity and accuracy. The pipeline identifies and resolves assembly conflicts, orders and orients sequence contigs, and estimates gap sizes between adjacent sequences.

The scaffolding workflow involves:

1. In Silico Map Generation – Converting sequence assembly into a map format for alignment.
2. Conflict Resolution – Aligning in silico maps to Bionano genome maps and identifying misassemblies.
3. Hybrid Scaffolding – Merging high-confidence sequence and optical maps into a refined scaffold.
4. Final Alignment – Mapping sequence contigs back to the hybrid scaffold for consistency validation.
5. Output Generation – Producing final AGP and FASTA files with corrected genome structures.

**What is the source of this data?**

- The optical genome mapping data was obtained from the project [PRJEB50694](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB50694).  
- Data corresponds to _Arabidopsis thaliana_ ecotype Col-0, generated using Bionano optical genome mapping technology.  
- The dataset is publicly available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and can be downloaded using:  
- The `.cmap` file contains high-resolution optical maps used for scaffolding and structural validation of genome assemblies.

To download:


```bash
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR522/ERR5229977/Col-0_2021-09-30.cmap
```



## Installation and Setup  


Bionano Solve is available on Bionano.com and can be installed on Linux-based systems. The software requires a valid license and access to Bionano data files for processing. 

Custom container with just the hybrid scaffolding tools can be used to run the Bionano Solve pipeline. On Negishi, you can add it to your PATH using the command below:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/biocontainers/exported-wrappers/bionano/3.8.0
```

## Running Bionano Solve

To scaffold a genome using Bionano Solve, you need to provide the following input files:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/biocontainers/exported-wrappers/bionano/3.8.0
run_hybridscaffold.sh

### Scffolding HiFiasm assembly with Bionano Solve

For HiFiasm assembly, you need to provide the HiFiasm assembly FASTA file as input to the Bionano Solve pipeline. The command structure remains the same, with the only change being the input sequence file.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/biocontainers/exported-wrappers/bionano/3.8.0
run_hybridscaffold.sh \
  -c /opt/Solve3.7_10192021_74_1/HybridScaffold/1.0/hybridScaffold_DLE1_config.xml\
  -b Evry.OpticalMap.Col-0.cmap \

  -u CTTAAG \
  -z results_bionano_hifiasm_scaffolding.zip \
  -w log.txt \
  -B 2 \

  -p /opt/Solve3.7_10192021_74_1/Pipeline/1.0 \
  -o bionano_hifiasm_scaffolding
```



### Scffolding Flye assembly with Bionano Solve


For Flye assembly, the process is similar to HiFiasm, but you need to provide the Flye assembly FASTA file instead of the HiFiasm assembly. The command structure remains the same, with the only change being the input sequence file.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/biocontainers/exported-wrappers/bionano/3.8.0
run_hybridscaffold.sh \
  -c /opt/Solve3.7_10192021_74_1/HybridScaffold/1.0/hybridScaffold_DLE1_config.xml\
  -b workshop_assembly/col-0_bionano/Evry.OpticalMap.Col-0.cmap \

## Understanding Hybrid Scaffolding Output

The output of the Bionano Solve pipeline includes scaffolded genome assemblies in AGP and FASTA formats, along with alignment and conflict resolution information. The hybrid scaffolds provide a more accurate representation of the genome structure, with improved contiguity and reduced misassemblies. The output files can be visualized using genome browsers or alignment viewers to assess the quality and completeness of the assembly.

| **Folder** | **Contents** |
|------------|-------------|
| **agp_fasta/** | Final scaffolded genome assembly in FASTA, AGP format, alignment results, gap information, and logs. |
| **align0/** | Initial alignment of optical maps to the sequence assembly, including XMAP, CMAP, and error logs. |
| **align1/** | Secondary alignment refinement, similar to align0 but after resolving initial inconsistencies. |
| **align_final/** | Final alignment results of hybrid scaffolds to optical maps, including mapping rates and statistics. |
| **assignAlignType/** | Tracks conflicts between NGS contigs and optical maps, includes exclusion and trimming decisions. |
| **cut_conflicts/** | Stores files related to contig trimming and conflict resolution between NGS and optical maps. |
| **fa2cmap/** | Converts the sequence assembly into Bionano’s CMAP format before integration with optical maps. |
| **hybrid_scaffolds/** | Contains final scaffolded genome with CMAP, XMAP, AGP files, and a scaffolding report. |
| **mergeNGS_BN/** | Stores intermediate files merging NGS contigs with Bionano maps, including hybrid scaffold progress. |
| **results_output.zip** | Compressed archive containing essential scaffolding results for easy sharing. |


Within `hybrid_scaffolds`, the files ending with `HYBRID_SCAFFOLD.fasta` and `HYBRID_SCAFFOLD_NOT_SCAFFOLDED.fasta` represent the final scaffolded genome and unplaced contigs, respectively. 
You will need to merge these files to obtain your final scaffolded genome assembly.


## Quality Assessment of Hybrid Scaffolds


The hybird scaffolds report file will be in the `hybrid_scaffolds` directory and will provide a summary of the scaffolding process, including alignment statistics, conflict resolution, and scaffold N50 values. This report is essential for evaluating the quality and completeness of the hybrid scaffolds and identifying any potential issues that need further investigation.

## Which assembler and data performed better?

- The HiFiasm assembly with PacBio HiFi data resulted in a higher N50 length and total length in the hybrid scaffold compared to the Flye assembly with ONT data.
- The conflict resolution process involved more cuts in the NGS sequences for the HiFiasm assembly, indicating a higher level of alignment discrepancies.
- The final hybrid scaffold from the HiFiasm assembly had a higher N50 length and total length, suggesting better contiguity and completeness compared to the Flye assembly.
